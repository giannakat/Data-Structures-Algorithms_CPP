# ArrayList Implementation in C++

This file contains a c++ implementation of an **ArrayList** data structure. It includes basic functionalities such as adding, removing, and accessing elements in the list, with automatic resizing.  

## What I Learned
- Dynamic memory management with 'malloc' and 'realloc'.
- Handling exceptions to prevent program crashes.
- Building a custom dynamic array based on 50% growth rate.

## Features
- Add elements at the end or at specific position
- Remove elements by value or by position
- Resize array dynamicalled as elements are added or removed
- Exception handling for invalid operation

### To be added soon
- **Time complexity**: computation of T(n) for each method (Priori Analysis)
