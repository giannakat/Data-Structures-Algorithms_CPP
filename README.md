# DATA STRUCTURES AND AlGORITHM

This repository contains multiple C++ implementations of data structures and algorithms, including:

**ArrayList:** Dynamic ArrayList implementation with automatic resizing.  
**LinkedList:** to be added soon.  
**Sorting Algorithms:** to be added soon.  
**Searching Algorithms:** to be added soon.  


## How to Use
- Each subdirectory contains its own README file with specific instructions.
- Navigate to each folfer for more details on a particular implementation.

  
## About
This repository is for practicing and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. Each implementation is part of my journey to  build deeper understanding of the core concepts needed in computer science as part of my Computer Science curriculum.  

Feel free to learn from it, improve it, or use it for your own learning.
